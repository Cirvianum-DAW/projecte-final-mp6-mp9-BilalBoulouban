# MP9 DAW - UF2 Project - Multimedia resources in WebApps\_

## Abans de començar

- Per fer aquesta pràctica, necessitem d'una pàgina web. Et recomano que treballis amb la pàgina que vam realitzar a l'anterior projecte i facis les modificacions i/o adaptacions necessàries per realitzar el que es demana. Si no has realitzat el projecte anterior, és molt recomanable aprofitis per aprendre alguns conceptes bàsics de TailwindCSS i et creïs una pàgina web senzilla per poder dur a terme el que es demana. Tens a la teva disposició els recursos de Tailwind dins la secció de UF1 d'aquesta assignatura. Per començar pots fer un cop d'ull al següent video: [Curso Práctico de Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwNklJxbsw0&ab_channel=Aprendible).

Us deixo alguns exemples de webs realitzades pels vostres companys i que us poden servir de referència:

Anem a veure què haureu de realitzar en aquest projecte amb el que tancarem la UF2:

## Project Goals

- Add the multimedia resources to a web project (images, videos, etc.).
- Optimize the multimedia resources to improve the performance of the web.
- Use different tools and techniques for optimizing multimedia resources.
- Learn about image-related and integrated tools in web development environments.

## Background

This last days we've been seeing different tools and techniques for optimizing multimedia resources. We've seen how to change the format of an image, how to reduce its size previous to its use in a web.

Let's see some of the core concepts on image optimization:

- **Prefer Vector Formats:**

  - Vector images are resolution and scale independent, suitable for multi-device and high-resolution environments.

- **Minify and Compress SVG Assets:**

  - Remove unnecessary metadata from XML markup in SVG assets.
  - Ensure servers are configured for GZIP compression for SVG assets.

- **Prefer WebP or AVIF Over Older Raster Formats:**

  - WebP and AVIF images are usually smaller than older formats.

- **Pick Best Raster Image Format:**

  - Determine functional requirements and select the format that suits each asset.
  - Use the right format and resolution for each image depending on the context.
  - Use art direction to serve different images for different devices.

- **Experiment with Optimal Quality Settings for Raster Formats:**

  - Don't hesitate to reduce "quality" settings; the results are often good with significant byte savings.

- **Serve Scaled Images:**

  - Resize images to ensure the "display" size is close to the "natural" size.
  - Pay attention to large images as they contribute to significant overhead when resized.

- **Automate, Automate, Automate:**
  - Automated tools can help us with optimization of all image assets without manual intervention.

Images are very important for the responsiveness of our website. But also it is very important the size of these images as we grow our website.

## Project Tasks - WHAT I NEED TO DO.

Starting from your website from the first project, you'll need to ensure the following requirements. This is, you've to make the necessary changes, if not yet implemented, to ensure that your website meets the following requirements:

1. **Header and Footer:**

   - Design a simple header with a title and a basic logo created by you.
   - Create a footer with links to all pages.

2. **Responsive Design:**

   - Ensure the WHOLE website is responsive for various devices. This is an opportunity to improve the responsiveness weaknesses.
   - Incorporate the use of different images (resolution/size) for different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop). You can use the `srcset` attribute to do this.
   - Incorporate at least one element with art direction (different images for different devices). You can use the `picture` element to do this.

3. **Image Optimization:**

   - Make a decision about the format that you want to use for your images and explain why you've chosen that format.
   - MANUALLY (as you have done with the tasks in this UF) optimize AT LEAST TWO images on the website.
   - Compare the original image on the website with the optimized image. Use the developer tools to compare the size of the images (Before/After)
   - Investigate and show how to optimize an image using Imagemin or Sharp tools. This are tools that can be used to optimize images automatically.
   - Check also how Parcel can help you to AUTOMATE the optimization of images of your website. Explain how you did it.

4. **CSS Clip-Path & Animations:**

   - Add a CSS animation to an element on the homepage.
   - Add also a CSS clip-path to an element on the homepage.

5. **Perfomance tools - PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse**

   - Do it BEFORE and AFTER the optimization of the images.
   - Run a test on PageSpeed Insights and Lighthouse to check the performance of your website.
   - Take a screenshot of the results and add it to your documentation.

6. **Documentation:**
   - You can use a document (PDF), markdown or a page of your Website to document main aspects with a focus on image optimization (format and size comparison). Just make sure to write the keypoints of the project (formats, sizes, techniques, tools, etc.)
   - Once you have it, create a video of **no more than 2min** with a repid explanation of the main aspects covered. Include how you have optimized the images using Imagemin or Sharp + how to use Parcel to automate the optimization of images of your website.

### Structure Reminder

You need to follow the structure of the first project. There're some changes but the general structure keeps the same.

#### Homepage

- Include at least one graphic resource edited with clip-path. Get creative! Cut an image and create a shape that integrates well into the page.

#### Detail Page

- Add a representative featured image that explains the page's content.
- Ensure the image is well-integrated into the design for both mobile and larger screens.
- Include at least two additional images (excluding header and footer), preferably in various formats (properly justified in the practice documentation).

#### Category Page

- Display the chosen featured image from the detail page, similar to platforms like Amazon, where a small image is visible during a search, and it enlarges when you enter the product page.

#### Presentation Page

- Include at least one graphic resource made with SVG on this page.
- The SVG should have a small animation using CSS.

#### Links Page

- Add your video tutorial to the links page.
- It's very important to be sure about the use of copyrighted material.
- Ensure compliance with limits and exceptions when using copyrighted materials.
- All resources requiring acknowledgment of rights must be correctly recognized and linked on this page.

## Evaluation Criteria:

**Development (70%):**

- Creation and/or modification to use of the appropriate and optimized format of images (25%).
- Adaptation of the resources to have a good-looking, optimized, responsive design (25%).
- Clip-Path and Animation (10%).
- Use of image-optimization tools (10%).

**Documentation (30%):**

- Documentation quality of the development process (15%).
- Quality of the video explanations and justifications (15%).

**Important Note:**

- PUBLISH YOUR WEBSITE (Netlify, GitHub Pages, etc.) AND ADD THE LINK IN THE DOCUMENTATION.
- MAKE SURE TO MAKE IT CLEAR IN YOUR MOODLE SUBMISSION WHERE TO FIND THE DOCUMENTATION AND VIDEO.

### Intellectual Property and Plagiarism

When creating multimedia works, it is often unavoidable to use resources created by third parties. It is understandable to do so within the framework of a practice in the studies of this Master's program, as long as it is clearly documented and does not constitute plagiarism in practice.

Therefore, when submitting a practice that uses third-party resources, it should be accompanied by a document detailing the resources used. This document should specify the name of each resource, its author, where it was obtained, and its legal status — whether the work is protected by copyright or falls under another usage license (Creative Commons, GNU, GPL, etc.). The student must ensure that the chosen license does not explicitly prohibit its use within the scope of the practice. If the corresponding information cannot be found, it should be assumed that the work is protected by copyright.

Additionally, when digital works are used, the original files must be attached, and their source code, if applicable.
